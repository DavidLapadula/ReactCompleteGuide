- App runs only in the browser
- Components for user interfaces
	- Contained pieces of code, allows making it manageable, easy to change, and reusable
- Babel preprocesses to allows jsx, which compiles back down to HTML/JS 
- Configure dynamically using props, which by default contains all attributes you are adding to the elements. Curly braces to templates attributes passed to component
- Not allowed to have adjacent elements; could have variable that returns jsx and then render calls that variable (root)
	- Nested components allow for SPA
- Avoid targetting elements, and traversing DOM with vanilla js
- Allows focusing on BL instead of application view
- SPA vs MPA
	- One HTML page from server, then all managed with JS, components rendered on the fly
		- Never have to reach back to server, all managed by react and root component
		- One render call because one root element initially rendered
	- Content rendered on server and returned, different pages returned from the route
		- Widgets do not know of each others existence
- Adding SSH Keys
