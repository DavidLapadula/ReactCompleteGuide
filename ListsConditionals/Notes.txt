- Bound arrow function, 'this' returns class
- All in render() gets executed when change to DOM, and JSX only in return statement
	- Put conditionals above return() to handle conditional checks
- map() executes fn on each element, so can return jsx from this fn to render the list
	- first parameter is element, second is index
- Even if mutate new variable with state property, still mutating because just getting reference to value held by react
	- Make a COPY first: spread operator into new array/object, or empty splice() method
- Cannot mutate state, or even the reference when stored in intermediary variable
- Key property helps React adjust DOM from lists, faster to track elements and which have changed
	- Virutal DOM to see what would be rendered with what has been rendered
