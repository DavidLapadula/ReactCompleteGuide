- Can have dynamic input element by setting the return jsx to a specific type of component like input or textarea
	- Props can then be spread into the element so that any JSX specific attributes will automatically be  distributed to the component on render
- Can use config options for creating custom elements, which are then spread in as props
- Need to update value on input, part of two way binding
	- Use anon function to pass argument; so can pass identifier to the input to change the value
	- Spread operator will not make deep clone of nested objects, need to make another clone of object you want to modify
- Classes can take an array, can push new classes onto array like for error issues
- Can also render error messages and text conditionally if the messages were passed in
	- Can pass in 'touched' as prop to see if the user has been on the form
	- Can pass in shouldValidate as prop to determine if that element should be validated at all
		- Any messages or error styling can be handled conditionally based on these props passed in
