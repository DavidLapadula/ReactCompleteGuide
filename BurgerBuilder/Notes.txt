- Component Tree > Application State > Components vs Containers
- Split components based on functionality
- propTypes allow for additional validation beyond type
- Making state object is just shorthand for running constructor and using this.state
- Can render nested arrays of jsx as if flattened, but then can flatten with the same result
- Can pass function reference with argument using arrow function than can fired on click in component when it has been passed down
- setState() not always guaranteed to update values if being used in other method, safer to pass object to methods using the state
- Webpack takes all folders and bunldes it to optimize, so need to import assets like images to make webpack aware image is being used
- boolean props can be passed without jsx braces
- CSS modules will allow for scoped classes for differnt files so can have same class name on differet components without interference
- Use function version of setState when using previous property of state because async does not guarantee value is correct
- Pure components and shouldComponentUpdate is only for unecessary re-renders
	- shouldComponentUpdate() will give you the next props and next state to perform check
	- React.memo will have the same effect of only rendering when necessary
