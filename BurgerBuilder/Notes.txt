- Component Tree > Application State > Components vs Containers
- Split components based on functionality
- propTypes allow for additional validation beyond type
- Making state object is just shorthand for running constructor and using this.state
- Can render nested arrays of jsx as if flattened, but then can flatten with the same result
- Can pass function reference with argument using arrow function than can fired on click in component when it has been passed down
- setState() not always guaranteed to update values if being used in other method, safer to pass object to methods using the state
