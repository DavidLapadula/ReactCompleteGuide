- Route component with path property to render certain active route
    - Component prop is what happens when that route is hit
        - Pass reference to function or class that you want to render
    - Also a render function that returns jsx for simpler version
- Exact determines of the complete path is a match
- Link ('a' tag) will reload the page and therefore lose state, do not reload but just re-render parts of the DOM (stay inside of application)
	- Link component instead of anchor tag  so it will prevent loading the page (use 'to' prop), can add path and query parameters
- React router passes information in the props, as well as methods like goBack, goForward and pushing new pages
- withRouter HOC
	- Props not passed through History if just a component
	- withRouter will make it 'route aware' and get information from the props of the nearest loaded route, and getting routing related props
- 'to' property is default absolute path with domain,  can use this.props.match.url to builld a dynamic relative path
- Only with NavLink object
	- Can use activeClassName to determine which class gets added when the route is mathched to the active link
	- Can use activeStyle to inline style when active
- :id is flexible route parameter, that can accept rouute parameters
- Parameter from the params are then in the props sent in to the component
- URLSearchParams comes with vanllaJS and will give you iterable entries for all the argumnts passed into route
- Switch compoenent will render only the FIRST route that matches
- 'History' of Link prop will allow you to push onto a different place in the navigation stack
- Can use Route whenever you want as long as it is wrapped in BrowserRouter
- Make path dynamic by setting path to an object and using props from match value (contains url)
