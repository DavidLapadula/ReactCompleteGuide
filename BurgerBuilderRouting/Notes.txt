- Route component with path property to render certain active route
    - Component prop is what happens when that route is hit
        - Pass reference to function or class that you want to render
    - Also a render function that returns jsx for simpler version
- Exact determines of the complete path is a match
- Link ('a' tag) will reload the page and therefore lose state, do not reload but just re-render parts of the DOM (stay inside of application)
	- Link component instead of anchor tag  so it will prevent loading the page (use 'to' prop), can add path and query parameters
- React router passes information in the props, as well as methods like goBack, goForward and pushing new pages
