- const for never changing, let for varying values
	- var is fn scoped (so throughout program), let is block scoped
- Arrow function always binds this keyword so never changed on runtime
	- omit parentheses for one arg
	- one line, no parentheses, no brackets, and no return 
- Export/Import
	- default just means default, so that is what is expected to export and can call it anything, as supposed to name
	- use alias for named export in curly braces, or using * for everything as an alias
- Class as blueprint for object, has properties and methods, and instantiated with new
	- Used as constructor function, and allow inhertiance
	- Extends inherits properties from super, and requires calling super of parent class 
	- es7 does not require calling constructor, and method is just property that stores function
- Spread: split object or array elements and merge into new. used to copy arrays/objects
- Rest: used to merge list of arguments into array, can then call methods on them
- Extract elements/properties and store in variables
	- Can use spread to assign multiple
	- Can pull single elements; arrays goes by order and object goes by property name
- Prim types copied makes a new one, reference just copies the reference because only using a point in memory
	- Spread operator will allow making a copy of a reference type
- Array functions take a function and perform it on the array
