- Context API
    - add value to provider and any component wrapped in provider will have access to it, even when it changes
    - can use useContext hook and pass in context to access values on it
    - method defined inside context file and passed in as 'value' to exported component can be called with only useContext in another component
    - good for low frequency updates
        - doesnt know which components are using context, so rebuilds everything using
        - low frequency changes like authentication
- Custom state management
    - if component uses custom hook, and the custom hook uses useState, when useState triggers re-render - component that uses it will also
    - define global objects in custom hook then can share data and functionality across components
    - cleanup from useEffect (what is returned) will can be used as a cleanup function
