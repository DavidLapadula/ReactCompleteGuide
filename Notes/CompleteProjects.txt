- if own component, even styles need to be handled to work properly
- incoming classes must be handled in props and then passed into custom component
- all components just extending built in html
- 2 way binding of putting state value as 'value' is what allows it to change
- prefix string with '+' will force type coercion
- Lifting the state up
    - want to manage state at highest level component
    - use fn form when setting state requires previous state
- Adding a modal
    - general overlay over the entire app
    - add backdrop class that covers whole page with high z index
    - use state snapshot (with use state where function updates the object also returned)
    - every native jsx with come with onclick, so just pass method to handler to un-render the backdrop
