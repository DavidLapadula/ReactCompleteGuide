- FN pass to use effect SHOULD NOT return a promise, can return a cleanup and should run sync
    - Define nested async fn inside instead 
- No dep array when fetching from a server because only want to happen when page loads
- Cannot try/catch in useEffect because would then need to be asycn to catch promise, so use .catch instead
