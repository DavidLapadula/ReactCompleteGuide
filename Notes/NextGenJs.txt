- const for variables that do not change and cannot be reassigned, let for variable values (function scoped)
- 'this' value keeps context inside arrow function, dows not change at runtime
- Can remove parentheses with 1 arg, or remove function body if all it does is return
- Exports and Imports allows for modular code so js files know their dependencies
- Default keyword: base export and can import without braces in another file
- Named exports use braces, ie nothing marked as default
- Class is blueprint for object, properties and methods.
	- Constructor runs whenever class is instantiated
	- 'this' keyowrd sets  properties
	- Allow for inheritance (prototypes)
	- Need to call super() to initialize parent constructor
