- can import images. creates dynamic url behind the scenes supported by CRA
- spread props onto own component and will use k/v as props
    - {type: input} --> type="input"
- drilling props can make comp more reusable because can be called from wherever vs using context
- provider exports data and provides data to the comps that require it
    - Export wrapping function with provider so can just wrap child and will have access
- comp using context will be re-evaluated whenever ctx changed
- update state immutably or else reference values can change and values in memory can change without react knowing about it
