- Transition property: define how transitions occur but setting which property, length and effect type
- Transition works with transform to determine what should be transformed
- Animation
    - can define keyframes and add it to the 'animation' property of another css class
    - gets added whenever the css class gets added to the DOM element
    - limit because just using css means it will always be on the DOM, which is not great
    - react also doesnt check for animations when removing from the dom
- React Transition Group
    - Wrap component you want to be effected by transition in Transition
    - has in property to determine it should show and timeout for how long the transition b/w states is held
         - also mounting props for if it should be removed from the dom
    - It tracks the transition over time so you can update it
    - Manages 4 states: Entering-Entered Exiting-Exited. We can then animate in between these states
    - returns a function with the current state from the 4 options
    - can then set styles based on the state you have
    - Can pass the state from Transition down through props to child elements of those it wraps
    - Timeout can take an object with enter/exit keys, which will determine different timings for transitions
    - Callbacks available on Timeout to do things when events occur: onEnter/Entering/Entered and also for exit
        - Executed when passing through different modes
- CSS Transition Component
    - classNames prop: which classes should be added to child component
    - class you pass in, need to define class as trunk <class>-enter/enter-active/exit, and will get added based on transition state
    - DO NOT need to manually set classes, just define classes in the code
    - classnames also takes a object with keys enter/enterActive. Can avoid trunks
- Transition group (lists)
    - used to render lists, but must be list of transition component
    - will set 'in' property on nested CSSTranition property whenever an item changes
        - This depends on classes you define with the trunk
