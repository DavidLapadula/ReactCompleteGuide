- Effects
    - React's job is to render to UI and react to input. Eval and render jsx, manage state/props, etc.
    - Side effects are anything else beside this core features: http, localStorage, timers
        - Not related directly to rendering something on the screen. So OUTSIDE component function as it is re-rendered when sth changes
    - useEffect() hook. Arg 1 is function that runs IF dependencies of second arg change NOT when re-rendered
    - localStorage type of effect
        - Large disadvantage to setting state on page load - state setting will cause re-render -> cause page load -> set state = infinite loop
    - useEffect() run AFTER render will prevent this loop with dependencies, since ONLY runs when dep change, so no re-render
    - dependencies are things you are looking for that will change, including function pointers
        - Only runs if dependency changed in last re-render cycle
        - setState variables provided by useState guaranteed to never change
    - Use on first time render to prevent loop AND after props/state change to trigger something
    - Updating data (even though using state) STILL side effect. Any time need response to non-core react feature
    - ONLY THINGS inside/internal to component that change on re/render
    - Debounce input (only when stops)
        - useEffect() you can return fn that acts as cleanup. runs BEFORE state fn, but not before the first time and when removed
        - before every execution and DOM unmount
        - timeout will cause stall, so clear it on cleanup its always reset. only runs when you stop
- Reducers and useReducer()
    - better state management (when state updates depend on other state). i.e related state
    - set state based on its previous value AND other state could lead to bug
        - even if use fn form, only getting latest state for THAT value, not any others
        - BUT w/ useEffect() run whenever dependencies change (state values) so guaranteed the latest
    - react schedules state updates, could get dated value of state b/c not processed in time
    - useReducer()
        - use for more complex state updating when guaranteed to work with latest state snapshot
        - return state snapshot and fn to dispatch an action. Dispatched to first arg
            - reducerFn: triggered when action dispatched: receives prevState and returns new state 
                - does need to be in function because does not need access to fn info, receives as args
            - initial state
            - initial fn
        - function to dispatch TRIGGERS dispatch function 
        - prevState you get as first argument in reducer guarantees correct prevState
        - w/ useEffect, make sure ONLY runs when required to change. Do not pass object b/c then changes when any property changes
- Context
    - Component wide, behind the scenes storage
    - need to PROVIDE and CONSUME it
        - When call it, need to pass value object - all consuming components can then use. Default value IN context only used when consumed w/o provider
        - Provide: wrap components that need to listen to it. Use provider and app + descendents get access
        - Consume:
            - Can wrap everything in consumer, return function with anon fn that gives you value and return jsx, where you can use value
                - this way requires value prop on provider, which is passed to all listening components
            - useContext(): 
                - just import function, import context reducer and then pass to useContext
                - can pas down values and function pointers
    - data usually passed to components through props. Use context when passing through multiple or for something very specfic
