- Hooks limited to fn components
- Allow state in fn components. Remove class based b/c they have more code overhead
- React.memo - only re-render when props change 
- Use const because variables dont change in render cycle
- In class based, setState merges with existing but with useState it relaces it
- Function update to chaneg state so get latest value
- Closure locks in values to ensure value is save for usage. Could be issue if updating by keystroke
- Hooks need to be at root level of project or loops/ifs
- Fn form best used when need to add to state like adding to list
- Fn you pass to useEffect after render and re-render cycle. Second arg are dependencies and will only run when they change
    - Similar to componentDidMount
    - Can destructure props and use as dependency to ensure useEffect runs when necessary
