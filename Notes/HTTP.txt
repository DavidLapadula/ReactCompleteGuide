- JS never talks to database
- Anything in browser can be read, so cannot put queries in there, or creds
- FE talks to BE (which cant accessed) and then that talks to DB
- REST / GQL is just different ways of exposing data
- GET req's
    - fetch() api to get/send
    - response object has built in json() to convert
    - async/await
        - async in front of function and then store in await block and remove .then()
- Errors
    - .catch() or try/catch
    - fetch DOESNT throw error for error status, axios does
- Integrate useEffect()
    - code for component render, but NOT re-render
    - should point at fn's you are using because they could change
    - will lock fn in so wont change and can be used as dep for useEffect
