- Simplify building UI
- Core feature is Component
    - All UI are made of components. Made of different building blocks
    - All UI can be split in this way
    - React just tells you how to fuse them together
- Reusability (DRY) AND Separation of Concerns (Feature only does 1 thing)
- Builds on idea of splitting code for above two concerns
- React is Decalarative
    - HTML/CSS/JS constitute a component
    - Build reusable and reactive components
    - 'Declarative': do not tell when to insert element in UI
        - You define end state and then React handles DOM instructions
        - You DO NOT write DOM instructions on your own
