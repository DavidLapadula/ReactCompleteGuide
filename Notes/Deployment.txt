- Test --> Optimize --> Build (minified and bundled) --> Upload to server
- Lazy Loading
    - User needs to wait until all code is downloaded. So want to make that as small as possible and only download code when needed
    - Load some code only when needed
    - React.lazy to import code and then only executed when needed
        - Need fallback UI in case lazy loading takes longer than render
        - React Suspense will take fallback, wrap components where lazy used
- Buildng app for production: "npm build" to build - optimize and shrink
    - Will create a build folder, which will have all code for prod
- SPA is static: only HTML/CSS/BrowserJS
    - Only need static hosting provider
- Usually different HTML triggers different action from server
    - With react, path needs to be ignored, so only serve react code.
