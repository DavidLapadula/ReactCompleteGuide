- React to button clicks have access to native DOM events. Value needs to be something executed when event occurs
- Only object reference to handler to prevent function being executed when line of code evaluated
- How react parses code
    - Component is just a function that returns jsx
    - Using components is like a function call - when react evaluates the component
    - Calls component as 'function', and then any fn's inside them until there are none left
        - Translates to DOM instructions, which starts with root component at initial rendering
        - After initial rendering, react DOES NOT repeat that, so need state
            - State allows component to be RE-EVALUATED
