- React to button clicks have access to native DOM events. Value needs to be something executed when event occurs
- Only object reference to handler to prevent function being executed when line of code evaluated
- How react parses code
    - Component is just a function that returns jsx
    - Using components is like a function call - when react evaluates the component
    - Calls component as 'function', and then any fn's inside them until there are none left
        - Translates to DOM instructions, which starts with root component at initial rendering
        - After initial rendering, react DOES NOT repeat that, so need state
            - State allows component to be RE-EVALUATED
- Component fn doesnt re-execute when variable changes
- useState will allow youu to define state variables - must be called at top level of component
    - Returns value and function to re-assign variables  (as array)
    - Calling hooks with update value and RE-EXECUTE component function
    - State required for data that may change in component (registered for each component instance)
    - useState call will only initialize on first call, subsequent renderings do not re-initialize the function
- Use onChange to react to changes for any input; onChange will pass event by default
- Multiple slices of state is valid, so multiple calls to useState
    - pass in object to useState for every item BUT need to maintain older pieces of state b/c other data will be clobbered by react
    - can spread existing state into useState to maintain values 
- When you update state and depend on previous state PASS FUNCTION to hook, and first argument will be prev state snapshot
- React schedules state updates, function way guarantees previous state snapshot is accurate
