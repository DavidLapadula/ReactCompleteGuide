- render a list using map()
- new state with useState, can use spread operator, but USE FUNCTION form, guarantees latest state snapshot
- key warning
    - key used to render lists efficiently. Tells react where a new item should be added
    - without key, react will re-render ALL elements, just views change updates array and then updates ALL items
        - could have bugs b/c if items stateful than state changes can be overwritten on re-render
    - map does return an index, but bad because index same for item and not attached to the id
