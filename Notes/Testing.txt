- Code that tests other code
    - Unit: smallest unit of or building blocks
        - Smallest scenario so know why they fail
        - Test success and error scenario
    - Integration: combination of multiple building blocks
    - e2e the app in its entirety
- Need to run test code and assert result
- In react need to simulate component in the browser
    - Jest runs tests and asserts success
    - React testing library is for rendering component
- App.test.js
    - test func that takes name and functon to run test
    - jest will watch files by default
- Three A's of testing 
    - Arrange (setup conditions and data), Act (run logic to be tested), Assert (see if output matches result)
    - screen from react testing library gives you access to virutal dom
- Test suites
    - organize by tests for 1 feature or component, created with describe
    - put tests in describe() to group them
- In the case of state changes, test scenarios when state changes
- Testing library - user event
    - allows you to trigger events in virtual screen
    - can target any element in the dom, even by role like button
    - so can use this library to trigger state changes and test things that occur when the state is changed
    - some methods only grab element if exists in the dom (getByText vs getByQuery)
- Connected components
    - render() will render the component tree, even with nested components
- Async tests
    - special way of testing for elements if they depend on async code because elements not there initially
        - find... queries return a promise and check for async code. React testing library will wait until promise returns 
            - can set amount of time it should take
        - test function pass into jest fn test() can be async to give access to await
- Mocks
    - Do not wanna sent req during tests. Could spam server, and could insert data into server b/c of post/put
        - Test could also fail because server is down
    - Do not send request, just send a mock. Just want to ensure code you wrote works
    - Dummy fn that does not send a real req
    - Change window.fetch to jest fn and this will allow you to mock the request without actually using fetch
